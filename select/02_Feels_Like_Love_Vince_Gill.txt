Look what my heart has gotten into
The sweetest gift I ever knew
Well it's even better than my favorite shoes
Look what my heart has found in you

(Well it)
Feels like sunshine
Feels like a rainbow
Feels like love finally called my name
(I wanna) jump and shout
(I wanna) sing and dance
Feels like love wants a second chance

Look what my heart clearly sees
How much I crave your company
What true companinon I will always be
Look what my heart has done to me

(Well it)
Feels like sunshine
Feels like a rainbow
Feels like love finally called my name
(I wanna) jump and shout
(I wanna) sing and dance
Feels like love wants a second chance

Looks like my heart has become
The safest place for us to rome
I'll be here for you when day is done
Looks like my heart has found someone

(Well it)
Feels like sunshine
Feels like a rainbow
Feels like love finally called my name
(I wanna) jump and shout
(I wanna) sing and dance
Feels like love wants a second chance
Feels like sunshine
Feels like a rainbow
Feels like love finally called my name
(I wanna) jump and shout
(I wanna) sing and dance
Feels like love wants a second chance
