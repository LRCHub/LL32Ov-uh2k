Layin' with my lady on the river bank
She looked over lazy and she gave me a wink
She said there's no sense working if it's this dang hot
So dip your toes in the water, baby, this is the spot

Well, it feels good, good, good
Yes, it feels right, right, right
Oh, it feels good, good, good
So we're gonna lay back and let it ride
Here we go!

Well, I bought a scratch-off ticket, well, the winning kind
When I saw the 97s in the checkout line
I got a 12-pack big sack carton of smokes
Now I'm dancing like I just saw the holy ghost

It feels good, good, good
It feels right, right, right
Oh, it feels good, good, good
So I'm gonna lay back and let it ride
Let it ride boy

You got them weekend warriors party whole night long
You got them moonshine lovers just getting it on
Does it make you feel happy?
Does it make your heart beat?
Does it make you shake it honey?
Does it make you move your feet?

It feels good, good, good
It feels right, right, right, oh
It feels good, good, good
So I'm gonna lay back and let it ride
Oh, it feels good, good, good, yes
It feels right, right, right, right
Yes, it feels good, baby, good, baby, good
So we're gonna lay back and let it ride (ride)
